		<h3>
		What problem it solves
		</h3>
	<p>
	It solves the problem of supervisers struggling to track the movements of employees in order to ensure the work has been done. It has gradually become an ineffective method with many time constraints and no customer satisfaction.
	</p>
		<h3>
		Benefits
		</h3>
	<p>
	It is beneficial in the sense that one is able to track/monitor employee movements in order to ensure that a certain criteria has been met and the consequences are well stipulated for both the supervisor and the employee. This helps avoid time wasting in order to promote effeciency in tasks issued.
